# TikTok-review-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Natural-Language-Processing


Overview

This repository contains a Python project aimed at analyzing user reviews from the Google Play Store for the TikTok app. By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we extract insights into user sentiment and the overall reception of the app. The project leverages libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NLTK for text processing, and Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization.

Repository Structure

tiktok.py: The main script containing the code for data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and data visualization.
images/: A directory containing visualizations of the sentiment analysis results.
Compound Score by Tiktok Star Review.png: A bar chart displaying the compound sentiment scores against the star ratings of reviews.
Count of Reviews.png: A bar chart showing the distribution of reviews across different star ratings.
Different Scores.png: A set of bar charts for positive, neutral, and negative sentiment scores across different star ratings.

Highlights

The analysis brings forward the correlation between sentiment scores and star ratings given by users. Visualizations highlight that higher star ratings generally correspond with positive sentiment, and lower star ratings show increased negative sentiment. Error bars indicate variability in sentiment within the same star rating, suggesting diverse user opinions.
